## Acceptance is generally calculated for testing with cuts:
## 	sim:	PhiPQ!=-9999, TargType!=-9999, pid==211; mc_PhiPQ!=-9999, mc_TargType==2, mc_pid==211.
## When adding Nphe cuts, these are implemented only for reconstructed data (i.e. not mc_<> variables).
## Easy cuts (S.Moran): Q2, Xb, Zh, Pt2, PhiPQ as seen in table 4.13 (p. 80) of his thesis
